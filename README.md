Welcome!

Thank you for checking out my RESTful api project

Project Description:

This project was a good exercise for practicing with USE, GET, POST, and DELETE. In this project, visiting several different routes (defined in app.js) will return different results. We can view our array which contains three objects,delete these objects, and modify or add to these objects based on the route we take.

How to open:

Using the command prompt, copy and paste 'code ~/oca/startnow-node101-vstda-api' and push enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To start and test this application, run 'node index.js' in Terminal, after navigating to the server folder. The endpoint base URL is http://localhost:8484. Refer to app.js for route options.
